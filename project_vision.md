# Project Vision

The goal of this project is to provide a detailed dataset report about different jobs in the data science sector with its salaries for all students who plan to advance into the data science industry so that they can illustrate their future plans. We aim to accomplish this with various graphing technologies and python by the end of this course. 

## Contracted Grade

For this project, we agree to contract for a A+.
